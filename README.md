# Hello, I'm Jereme
<a href="https://linkedin.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

Hi there! I'm passionate about cybersecurity and currently building my skills in GRC, SOC operations, and threat detection. My focus is on compliance frameworks like PCI DSS, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001, as well as hands-on experience with Wazuh, Splunk, and DLP solutions.

This repository showcases my cybersecurity projects, including SIEM configurations, security monitoring scripts, and compliance audits. My goal is to transition into a cybersecurity role where I can apply my knowledge to detect threats, secure systems, and ensure compliance.

## Objective

Passionate about cybersecurity with a deep commitment to protecting not just organizations, but the people who rely on them. I believe that security is more than just defending networks—it’s about safeguarding individuals, their privacy, and their trust in the digital world. My mission is to help create a safer cyber landscape by detecting threats, ensuring compliance, and promoting proactive security measures. Through continuous learning and ethical security practices, I strive to make technology a safer space for everyone
